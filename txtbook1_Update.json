The modifications are as follows: if the number is divisible by 5, subtract the first digit; if it is divisible by 3, subtract the second digit; if neither, add the third digit. You then output the result in a grid of N rows and M columns, where N is the sum of the first and second digits and M is the sum of the first and third digits. This problem is solved by first decomposing the number into its three digits and then running nested loops for rows and columns that print the modified number.

Each discount applies only if certain conditions are met, and the final price reflects all the applicable reductions."

In these problems, one loop controls the rows while an inner loop handles the characters in each row (such as spaces, asterisks, or other symbols). Mastering these constructs is essential because many exam problems require you to generate visual patterns or grids based on input parameters, and the ability to manipulate loops effectively means you can adapt to varied problem requirements quickly.\n\n*Analogy:* Imagine a mosaic artist who repeats a small tile pattern over a large surface.

One sequence is a Tribonacci sequence (each number is the sum of the previous three) and the other is a numerical spiral sequence generated by a particular pattern. Here is a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Input Processing:**\n   - Read three integers for the Tribonacci sequence; these are the starting values. They are positive non-zero numbers provided in ascending order.\n   - Read two integers for the spiral: the first number (starting value) and the step increment.\n\n2. **Generate the Tribonacci Sequence:**\n   - Initialize three variables with the given starting numbers.\n   - Using a loop (for instance, a while loop), calculate the next Tribonacci number by summing the last three numbers.\n   - Continue generating terms until you either exceed a given upper bound (e.g., one million) or until your candidate number is found in the other sequence.\n   - You can store these values in an array or list if desired, or generate them on the fly.\n\n3. **Generate the Numerical Spiral Sequence:**\n   - The spiral sequence is generated from a starting number and a constant step. However, the twist is that the effective addition changes in a cyclical pattern. For example, the first two numbers are generated by adding the step once, the next two by adding twice the step, then three times the step, and so on.\n   - Use variables to track the current multiplier (e.g., `spiralStepMul`), and a counter that increases; every two iterations, increase the multiplier by one. This captures the increasing gap as the spiral \u2018turns\u2019 in the matrix.\n   - Generate numbers in sequence until you exceed the given limit.\n\n4. **Finding the Crossing Point:**\n   - Once you have a method to generate numbers from both sequences, check for a common number. One strategy is to generate the Tribonacci sequence and, for each number generated, check if it also appears in the spiral sequence. Since the spiral can be generated in sorted order, you may use a linear search (or binary search if stored in an array) to check for existence.\n   - The first common number that does not exceed 1,000,000 is your output. If no such number exists within the range, print \"No\".\n\nThis problem requires careful planning of loops, conditional checks, and the strategy for synchronizing two independently generated sequences."

Create a `LocalDate` object for January 1 of the start year.\n   - Use a loop (either a while-loop or for-loop) to iterate day-by-day until you reach December 31 of the end year. The `plusDays(1)` method on LocalDate is used to increment the date correctly, handling month transitions and leap years automatically.\n\n3. **Computing the Magic Weight:**\n   - Each date is represented in the format ddmmyyyy (always 8 digits when considering day and month as 2-digit strings). You need to split the date into its individual digits. You can obtain the day, month, and year using `getDayOfMonth()`, `getMonthValue()`, and `getYear()` methods, and then extract each digit by using division and modulo arithmetic.\n   - Compute the weight by multiplying each digit by the sum of all digits that follow it. This can be grouped for efficiency. For example, if the digits are d1, d2, \u2026, d8, the weight = d1 * (d2 + d3 + ... + d8) + d2 * (d3 + d4 + ... + d8) + \u2026 and so on.\n\n4. **Filtering and Output:**\n   - For each date, if the computed weight matches the target weight, format the date into \"dd-mm-yyyy\" format using `DateTimeFormatter` (ensuring the month is always two digits with a leading zero) and add it to your output.\n   - After iterating over all dates, if no date has the target weight, print \"No\". Otherwise, print each matching date on a new line in ascending order.\n\nThis approach leverages Java's date-time library to eliminate manual error-prone date calculations and uses arithmetic operations to compute the desired weight."

There are exactly 5 letters.\n   - Use five nested loops (each ranging from 0 to 4) to generate all possible 5-letter combinations. Each loop corresponds to one position in the word. For instance, combination 00000 corresponds to \"aaaaa\" and 02423 corresponds to \"acecd\".\n   - For each combination of indices, convert the numeric representation into the actual letter using the expression `'a' + i`. This ensures the combinations are generated in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.\n\n3. **Removing Repeated Letters:**\n   - For each generated 5-letter word, process the string to remove duplicates. This is done by creating an empty string and, iterating over the characters of the combination from left to right, appending each character only if it is not already present in the string.\n   - For example, for the word \"bcddc\", the unique string becomes \"bcd\".\n\n4. **Computing the Weighted Sum:**\n   - Define the weights for letters: a = 5, b = -12, c = 47, d = 7, e = -32.\n   - For the unique string obtained after removing duplicates, calculate the total weight using the formula:\n     \\( weight = 1 * weight(c1) + 2 * weight(c2) + ... + n * weight(cn) \\)\n   - The position is determined by the order of the unique letters (note that indices start at 0, so you add 1 to get the multiplier for each letter).\n\n5. **Filtering and Collecting Results:**\n   - If the computed weight falls within the specified start and end range, add the original 5-letter combination (not the deduplicated one) to the result list.\n   - After processing all 5-letter combinations, if no combination qualifies, print \"No\"; otherwise, print the valid combinations space-separated.\n\nThis problem tests your ability to use nested loops, string manipulation (especially removing duplicates), and arithmetic operations to compute customized scores, all while ensuring the result is printed in alphabetical order without the need for additional sorting."

The use of Java\u2019s `LocalDate` and its `plusDays(1)` method is essential to correctly account for varying month lengths and leap years.\n\n2. **Extracting and Splitting Date Components:**\n   - Each date must be broken down into its constituent digits (day, month, and year). This requires careful manipulation: converting numbers to strings or using division and modulo operations to extract each digit.\n\n3. **Computing the Date Weight:**\n   - The weight is determined by taking every digit and multiplying it by each subsequent digit, then summing these products. This requires a clear understanding of both the order of digits and the arithmetic operations needed. Grouping operations can simplify the expression.\n\n4. **Filtering:**\n   - Only dates with a computed weight equal to a specified magic weight must be selected.

After a special trigger command (\u201cmall.Enter\u201d), the program starts reading a series of command strings\u2014each representing a series of purchase actions. Each character in a command string represents a different type of purchase or financial transaction based on its ASCII value and case. The rules are as follows:\n\n\u2022 If the symbol is a CAPITAL letter, Lina gets a 50% discount; she only pays 50% of the ASCII value of that symbol.\n\u2022 If the symbol is a lowercase letter, she gets a 70% discount; she pays 30% of its ASCII value.\n\u2022 If the symbol is \u2018%\u2019, then the purchase costs half of her current funds.\n\u2022 If the symbol is \u2018*\u2019, Lina performs a special transaction: she withdraws money from her debit card which adds 10 lv to her funds.\n\u2022 For any other symbol, she pays its full ASCII value.\n\nA purchase is only executed if Lina has sufficient funds (funds cannot go below zero). The shopping session ends when the command \"mall.Exit\" is encountered. Finally, the program prints either the number of purchases made along with the remaining money (formatted to two decimal places) or, if no purchase was made, an appropriate message.\n\n**Solution Strategy:**\n1. **Input Processing:** Read Lina\u2019s initial funds (as a BigDecimal for precise monetary calculations) and then continuously read commands from the console. Only begin processing when the command \"mall.Enter\" is encountered; stop when \"mall.Exit\" is read.\n2. **Command Processing:** For each command (string), iterate character by character. For each character:\n   - Determine its category (capital letter, lowercase letter, '%', '*', or other) using conditional checks (e.g., comparing against 'A' and 'Z' or 'a' and 'z').\n   - Compute the cost or modification to funds based on the rules (e.g., for a capital letter cost = ASCII code * 50%, for lowercase cost = ASCII code * 30%, for '%' cost = current funds / 2, etc.).\n   - If the funds are insufficient for that purchase, skip it (using continue).\n   - Otherwise, subtract the calculated cost from Lina\u2019s funds and increment a purchase counter.\n3. **Output:** After processing all commands (upon reading \"mall.Exit\"), print the number of purchases and the remaining funds formatted with two decimal places. If no purchase was made, output \"No purchases. Money left: {remaining funds} lv.\""

The sequence increases in a patterned way\u2014initially add the step for the first two numbers, then increase the multiplier by 1 every two numbers. For example, if the step is 2, then the first two numbers are previous value + 2, the next two are previous value + 4, and so forth.\n\n**Comparison Method:**\n- **Array-based Approach:** Generate the Tribonacci sequence and store its terms in an array. Similarly, generate the spiral sequence until its terms exceed 1,000,000. Then iterate through one array and check for membership in the other (using a linear or binary search). The first common term is the answer.\n\n- **On-the-Fly Approach:** Alternatively, maintain two pointers (one for each sequence) and generate terms incrementally from each. Compare the current terms:\n   - If they match, output that term.\n   - If one is lower than the other, generate its next term until you surpass or match the other.\n   - Continue until a match is found or both sequences exceed the limit. If no match is found, output \"No\".\n\nThis method avoids storing large sequences and is efficient if one sequence consistently lags behind the other."

        "value": "The 'X Expression' problem requires evaluating a mathematical expression provided as a string. The twist is that the expression is evaluated strictly from left to right regardless of the traditional operator precedence (except that any sub-expression enclosed in brackets is evaluated first). In other words, the expression is processed in the order the operators appear. For example, the expression may include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators, but you compute them sequentially as they are read from left to right.\n\n**Key Points of the Problem:**\n- The input is a single string ending with an '=' character, indicating the end of the expression.\n- Sub-expressions within parentheses are processed first. The expressions cannot have nested parentheses, but they may have multiple separate bracketed parts.\n- Each operator is applied in the order encountered (ignoring the standard mathematical priority), so if an expression is \"4+6/5+(4*9-8)/7*2=\", you calculate from left to right while first solving the bracketed expression.\n- The final result must be rounded to two decimal places and printed on the console.\n\n**Solution Strategy:**\n1. **Input Processing:** Read the entire expression string using a BufferedReader (or Scanner) until the '=' character.\n2. **Initial Variables:** Define a result variable (initially 0) and a variable to hold the current operator (default to '+').\n3. **Main Loop:** Iterate character by character through the expression. For each character:\n   - If it\u2019s a digit, convert it to a number (by subtracting '0' from its char value) and apply the current operator to update the result.\n   - If it\u2019s an operator, update the current operator variable.\n   - If it\u2019s an opening parenthesis '(', recursively (or with a nested loop) process the sub-expression until you hit a closing parenthesis ')', then apply the result of that sub-expression using the current operator.\n4. **Formatting Output:** Once the '=' is reached, format the result to two decimal places and print it.\n\nThe key challenge is correctly handling sub-expressions and ensuring that operator precedence is strictly left-to-right outside of parentheses."

The suggested numbers should be printed in ascending order on a single line, separated by spaces. If no valid number exists, print \"No\".\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. **Input Processing:** Read three lines: the secret number (as a string or integer), the number of bulls, and the number of cows.\n\n2. **Candidate Generation:**\n   - Use four nested loops (each ranging from 1 to 9) to generate every possible 4-digit number that satisfies the constraint (no zeros).\n   - For each generated combination, convert the digits into a number or string.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Bulls and Cows:**\n   - For each candidate, compare its digits with the secret number\u2019s digits. Count bulls by checking if the digit in the candidate matches exactly (both value and position) the digit in the secret.\n   - For cows, count the number of matching digits (ignoring those already counted as bulls) that exist in different positions.\n\n4. **Verification:** If the candidate's bulls and cows exactly match the desired counts, add it to a result list.\n\n5. **Output:** After processing all candidates, check if the result list is empty. If so, output \"No\".

Construct a LocalDate instance representing January 1 of the start year.\n\n2. **Iteration:** Use a loop (either a while loop or a for loop) that continues as long as the current date is before or equal to December 31 of the end year. In each iteration, use the `plusDays(1)` method of LocalDate to move to the next day. This method automatically takes care of incrementing months and years.\n\n3. **Weight Calculation:** For each date, convert the day, month, and year into a string of digits (ensuring leading zeros where necessary, for instance for months and days) and then compute its magic weight using the formula provided. \n\n4. **Checking and Output:** If a date's magic weight matches the target, format the date into the required format (using DateTimeFormatter with a pattern like \"dd-MM-yyyy\") and print it.

The weight of a letter is defined explicitly (for example, a = 5, b = -12, c = 47, d = 7, e = -32). For a 5-letter string, the weight is computed after first removing duplicate letters (keeping only the first occurrence) and then applying a weighted sum where each letter\u2019s weight is multiplied by its 1-based position in the unique string.\n\n**Solution Outline:**\n1. **Input:** Read two integers defining the start and end of the weight range.\n2. **Combination Generation:** Use five nested loops (each iterating from 0 to 4) to generate every possible 5-letter combination from the set. Map each numeric index to its corresponding letter (e.g., via an array or by casting (char)('a' + index)).\n3. **Remove Duplicates:** For each generated 5-letter string, create a new string that contains only the first occurrence of each letter, preserving the order. This can be done by iterating over the string and appending a letter to a result string only if it is not already present.\n4. **Calculate Weight:** For the deduplicated string, calculate the weight by multiplying the weight of each letter by its position (1-based index) in the string and summing these values.\n5. **Filter and Output:** If the computed weight lies within the given range, add the original 5-letter combination (with duplicates intact) to the result. All valid combinations should be printed in alphabetical order, separated by a space.

The return type is not considered part of the signature, so the overloads must differ by the parameter list.\n\n3. **Usage in Main:** In the main program, read three numbers from the console. Use the getMax methods to determine the smallest of the three by first comparing two numbers and then comparing the result with the third (e.g., int min = getMax(getMax(num1, num2), num3)).\n\nThis problem illustrates how method overloading enables writing a more general utility (getMax) that can handle different data types with the same method name, enhancing code clarity and reuse."

Each method performs a specific task, which simplifies debugging and future modifications.\n\n2. **Code Reusability:** Methods allow you to reuse code without duplicating it. For instance, if a particular calculation or output format is required in several places, you can write it once in a method and call that method wherever needed.\n\n3. **Improved Readability:** Descriptive method names (following conventions like lowerCamelCase for parameters and UpperCamelCase for class names) can clearly indicate the purpose of the code block, making it easier for others (and yourself) to read and understand the program.\n\n4. **Simplified Testing:** When functionality is encapsulated in methods, it is easier to test each component in isolation. This leads to more reliable and maintainable code.\n\n5. **Separation of Concerns:** Methods help separate the logic of processing data from user interface or input/output operations, following good design principles.\n\nThe chapter also emphasizes best practices such as using clear and descriptive names for methods and parameters, keeping methods short and focused, and proper code formatting and indentation to enhance overall code quality."
